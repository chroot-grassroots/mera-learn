# Pedagogical rationale:
# - Most users currently: SMS for everything, unencrypted email, no VPN, unprotected public WiFi
# - Goal: Understand what's protected vs exposed, use appropriate tools for context
# - Focus on achievable secure communication practices
# - Threat-model driven tool selection
